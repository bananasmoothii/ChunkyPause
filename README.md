### What this plugin does:

- On startup, it automatically runs `/chunky continue`
- When a player connects (and they are the first connected player), it runs `/chunky pause`
- When a player disconnects and no other player are online, it runs `/chunky continue`

That plugin is really tiny, it is only one class that you can see here: TODO
